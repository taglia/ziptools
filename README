------------------

This program lets you control a parallel or a SCSI zip drive with a nice
graphic interface. It is based on the work of Grant R. Guenther and Itai
Nahshon. The program uses the free version of Troll Tech Qt toolkit
(www.troll.no).

To build the dialogs I used Qt Architect, by Jeff Harris and Klaus Ebner.

To build it edit the Makefile and run make. To install it copy the file
ziptools wherever you want: You have to be root to configure the program (it
saves the configuration in /etc/ziptools.conf), but it can be used by normal
users (if you suid it : "chmod u+s ziptools" as root). It "should" be secure,
normal user "should not" be able to do anything dangerous, but I'm the only
one who tested it, so DON'T TRUST...
